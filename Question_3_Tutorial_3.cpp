Q3. An architectâ€™s fee is calculated as a percentage of the cost of a building. The fee is made as follows:
8% of the first RM 5000.00 of the cost of a building and
3% on the remainder if the remainder is less than or equal to RM 80,000 or
2.5% on the remainder if the remainder is more than RM 80,000.
